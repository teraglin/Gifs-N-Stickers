# Gifs n Stickers

### What is this?
**Gifs n Stickers** is a vanilla JavaScript application that utilises the **Giphy** API to search for gifs or stickers.
In addition **Gifs n Stickers** returns a maximum of ten results and the results are randomised every time.

### How does it work?
This application contains two buttons labeled '*Gifs*' and '*Stickers*'. Pressing one of these buttons will set it as the active button, and as such, will determine what kind of search is being made.
When searching for a gif or a sticker, this application will retrieve all available results from the **Giphy** API and store the results into an array. The results are then shuffled and the first ten results in the array are rendered to the user.
